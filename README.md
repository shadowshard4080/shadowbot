# shadowbot
A free and open source Discord bot, written in Python. This is NOT the main bot's actual code, it is a template so you can make your own version. The template uses ChatGPT and can be customized. You may have trouble getting ChatGPT to work because it no longer allows itself to "impersonate other entities."

If you know how to make your own instance of the bot, please edit the channel IDs, the owner ID, and the bot's name. Set up the .env file.
Refer to requirements.txt.

You can invite the official bot which runs a custom LLM to your server using this link:
